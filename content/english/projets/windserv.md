### Offshore wind farms role in securing biodiversity and ecosystem services: bridging the gap from a multi-model approach to services indicators.

The WindServ project proposes to assess the ecosystem services related to offshore wind farms and explore their relevance as other area-based effective conservation measures (OECM). This in an attempt to reconcile the "biocentric" and "anthropocentric" viewpoints in order to improve the acceptability of offshore wind farms. The challenge of WindServ is to produce indicators of ecosystem services relevant for the marine environment and for offshore wind farms grounded in ecological knowledge and models. The WindServ project is led by the [LOG](https://log.cnrs.fr/) laboratory (ULCO).

> Geo4Seas contributes to this project by providing its expertise in spatialization of anthropogenic activities and spatial optimization.

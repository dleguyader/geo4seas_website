### Feasibility study for the establishment of refuge areas in Martinique and Guadeloupe

This project aimed to propose recommendations for the definition of high protection area(s) (or refuge area) for one or more cetacean species particularly impacted by some anthropogenic pressures in the [Agoa Sancturay](https://sanctuaire-agoa.fr/). The team was a consortium involving [Aquasearch](https://www.aquasearch.fr/), UBO, MNHN, [MIRACETI](https://miraceti.org/) association and [M-EXPERTISE MARINE](https://www.m-expertisemarine.com/).

> Geo4Seas contributes to this project by providing its expertise in geomatics, and by the multi-scale analyses of maritime traffic in the Caribbean Basin, based on AIS (Automatic Identification System) data.

This project is funded by the [French Office for Biodiversity (OFB)](https://www.ofb.gouv.fr/).

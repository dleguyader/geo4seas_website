As part of our research activities carried out within the ([Appeal](../../projects/appeal)) project, Geo4Seas is developing a methodology to identify potential  sites of fewer constraints for offshore wind farms based on biological, economic and social indicators (Le Guyader, 2019).

### Issue

- How to identify potential offshore wind farm sites that maximise the  potential energy production while minimising negative interactions with biological and socio-economic compartments?

- How can this model be used to carry out spatialized prospective simulations according to different scenarios?


### Hypothesis

- The Systematic Conservation Planning conceptual framework can be used to identify potential siting sites.

Geo4Seas' research and development activities are based on the **modelling of the marine and coastal socio-system** using a **geomatic** approach, notably through GIS, spatial analysis, spatio-temporal modelling, interactive (geo)visualisations and prospective simulation.

Our work is oriented towards land and resource management, particularly in the context of Integrated Maritime and Coastal Management and Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP). Our activites are part of a reproducible and applied research aiming at the production of knowledge, methods and innovative tools by favouring projects that interact with management arenas.

Our recent R&D activities are based on several collaborative and multidisciplinary research programs within the [APPEAL](../../projets/appeal/), [TRAFIC](../../projets/trafic/) and [WINDSERV](../../projets/traffic/) projects.

> Among the human activities in the coastal zone, leisure activities, whether supervised or not, are particularly difficult to characterise. 

Methods to quantify the frequentation of leisure activities in marine and coastal areas are most often based on counts. These counts provide spatialized snapshots of visitor numbers for the observation period and at the sites being surveyed. However, as they are unevenly distributed in time and space and without an adapted sampling design, they do not allow to deduce a homogeneous view  of their distribution (in space and time). 

Thus, Geo4Seas is developing a solution that combines :
- **for non-supervised activities**, statistical modelling with machine learning from count data (Le Guyader *et al.*, 2018).
- **for supervised activities**, descriptive modelling by structuring a Geographic and Temporal Information Base (BIGT) from the digitising of administrative documents (AOT & DA) (Le Guyader, 2013).
